## Introduction

### Project Goals

The purpose of this project is to create a simple 2D rendering engine that is easy to use and extend. It is intended to
be used for displaying 2D pixel pixel-perfect (low resolution sprites) or pixelated (more complex vector based shapes)
graphics.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this project is developers who want to display 2D pixelated graphics for a small project and
don't want to spend time learning a complex rendering engine.

### Project Scope

The project scope includes the development of a linux based (may be changed to a cross platform solution) rendering
engine that can be used to display 2D pixelated graphics.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. The engine must be able to display pixelated graphics (vector based shapes).
2. The engine must be able to display pixel-perfect graphics (low resolution sprites).
3. The engine must be able to display text.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The engine must have a simple-to-use API.
2. The engine must be easy to extend.
3. The engine must be able to run on a linux based system.
